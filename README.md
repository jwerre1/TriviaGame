Timed Trivia Game

### What is it? / How to play?
This project is a classical music trivia game featuring eight timed multiple choice questions. After clicking the start button, you will have 20 seconds to answer the question. Once you select an answer, the player is alerted whether their choice was correct, and a fun gif also populates. If the player fails to answer in 20 seconds, a message populates alerting them of such.

After 5 seconds, another question then populates.

At the end, the player is shown how many questions they got correct, incorrect, and left unanswered; and a button is present for the player to restart the game.

The game utilized Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery.
